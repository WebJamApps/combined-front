      Josh began playing the trumpet when he was in third grade. He became skilled with the trumpet,
      continuing with his musical stylings through high school where he was first chair and regular
      soloist on the marching field. In college Josh studied music and picked up the guitar. He was
      primarily self-taught on the guitar, although he received help from his many musical relatives,
      especially his Uncle Mike. Josh went on to found several bands while living in central Florida.
      He recorded two cds and was played on the local radio stations. Josh also played in many
      venues including the Sun cruise casino ship and the Battle of the Bands. His career took a
      different turn when he moved to Virginia. Leaving his band behind, Josh played at the GE Pig
      roast several years and performed solo at Mill Mountain coffee shop and the 4th Street coffee
      shop. Josh started singing with Maria in the fall of 2011. They fell in love and were married
      in July of 2012. Vive l’amore!</p>

            <p style="text-align:left">Maria started her singing career at the age of 4 when she performed at the JaMar Rec
              Center in St. Petersburg, Florida. Maria continued adding to her musical repertoire
              by learning piano, alto saxophone, tenor saxophone, bassoon, and marching tenors.
              She earned a minor in voice at Roanoke College and did a variety of chorus, musical theatre,
              and solo performances while teaching in the Roanoke County Schools. Although classically
              trained, Maria loves singing rock and Christian music with Josh, and hopes to add bass
              guitar to her list of instruments soon. Josh is the most wonderful husband and is the driving
              force for the couple; Maria is a fabulous wife and is the organization behind the duo.</p>
